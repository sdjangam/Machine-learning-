# machine learning

Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome.

Machine Learning is a first-class ticket to the most exciting careers in data science. As data sources proliferate along with the computing power to process them, automated predictions have become much more accurate and dependable. Machine learning brings together computer science and statistics to harness that predictive power. It‚Äôs a must-have skill for all aspiring data analysts and data scientists, or anyone else who wants to wrestle all that raw data into refined trends and predictions.

In this modules, broadly I will talk about supervised as well as unsupervised learning. We will talk about multiple types of classifiers like Na√Øve Bayes, KNN, decision trees, SVMs, artificial neural networks, logistic regression, and ensemble learning. Further, we will also talk about linear regression analysis, sequence labeling using HMMs. As part of unsupervised learning, I will discuss clustering as well as dimensionality reduction. Finally, we will also discuss briefly semi-supervised learning, multi-task learning, architecting ML solutions, and a few ML case studies.
